Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric, the software implementation of blockchain IBM is committed to, is a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability.

In a Blockchain solution, the Blockchain network works as a back-end with an application front-end to communicate with the network using a SDK. To set up the communication between front-end and back-end, Hyperledger Fabric community offers a number of SDKs for a wide variety of programming languages like the NodeJS SDK and Java SDK. This code pattern explains the methodology to create, deploy and test the blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK Java.

It would be helpful for the Java developers, who started to look into Hyperledger Fabric platform and would like to use Fabric SDK Java for their projects. The SDK helps facilitate Java applications to manage the lifecycle of Hyperledger channels and user chaincode. The SDK also provides a means to execute user chaincode, query blocks and transactions on the channel, and monitor events on the channel. This code pattern will help to get the process started to build a Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.1 Java application.

When the reader has completed this pattern, they will understand how to create, deploy and test a blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK Java. This pattern will provision a Hyperledger Fabric 1.4.1 network consisting of two organizations, each maintaining two peer node, two certificate authorities (ca) for each organization and a solo ordering service. The following aspects will be demonstrated in this code pattern:

Create and initialize channel
Install and instantiate chain code
Register and enroll the users
Perform invoke and query on the blockchain network.
